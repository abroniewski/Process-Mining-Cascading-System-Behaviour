## Guid_to_run
For detecting systematic behavior leading to dynamic bottlenecks we should follow 5 steps. First step is detecting segemnt-level events from event log. We detect system-level events form detected segment-level events. Third step is relation detection between detected system-level events. When we detetc related system-level events, we apply cascade detection method to detect cascades of correlated system-level events. Final step is applying subgraph mining method.
